          <h3>WHAT IS THIS WORKSHOP?</h3>
            <p>
            The goal of Introduction to 3D Visualization( 3ds max and Vray ) is specifically designed to provide GSD Students with senses of digital representation in their design by ... <br> 
            (1) understanding common and holistic work flow for rendering and animation in 3ds max(Vray)<br> 
            (2) learning optimized tips and Know-hows for rendering and animation in 3ds max(Vray), and <br>
            (3) expanding the knowledge on the basis of topic-orient examples. <br> <br>
            To achieve it in the given time, the workshop can be divided into ... <br>
            (1) 3ds max’s interface(Controlling view, Full-down menu, and Panel), <br>
            (2) importing model from SktechUp and Rhino(group and layer),<br>
            (3) general creation (line, polygon, lighting, camera and material),<br> 
            (4) environment(Vray), <br>
            (5) animation (basic and advance animation)<br>
            (6) post-production(Photoshop for still image and AfterEffect for animation)<br><br>
            So that you will grasp ideas when it comes to visualze and represent your design as forms of images or videos. <br> <br>

            For those who have no background about this topic, here is my suggestion<br>
            (1) attend the workshop without any presure<br>
            (2) watch what the workshop is( just like watching movie or film because there are several magics and playful examples)<br>
            (3) memo what you are interest in for presentation of design in the future.<br>
            (4) with your problems, come to CODE WITHOUT FRONTIERS(CWF) which happen two times in a week<br>

            </p>

    
        
        <h3>WHO YOU ARE</h3>
            <p>
            This workshop is for those who are familiar with 3D software such CAD program as 3ds max, Maya, Rhino to develop an
            advanced 3D visualization skill, or those who want to understand the process of 3D visualization in Urban, Architecture,
            and Landscape architect representation as a form of a still image or a video.
          </p>
        <h3>OBJECTIVITY</h3>
          <p>
            * Maintaining quality of visualization</br>
            * Maximizing working performance in a given situation</br>
            * Leaning different types of the visualization processes in Urban, Architecture, and Landscape Architecture domains</br>
            * Understanding and expanding knowledge to other software in the digital environment</br>
            * Prepare for advanced visualization</br>
        </p>
        <h3>SOFTWARE</h3>
        <p>
            * Rhino, 3ds max, VRay, Photoshop, Aftereffect, Media Encoder, plugins, and scripts</br>
            * You need to install several plugins for 3ds max and Rhino Grasshopper<br>
            in the [data] folder<br>

             copy “gw_Ivy.dlo” in the plugin folder of the zip file <br>
            <code>    to “C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2016\stdplugs” </code> <br>
            copy “Greeble2015.dlm” in the plugin folder of the zip file  <br>
            <code>    to “C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2016\stdplugs” </code> <br>
            copy all of files in the addon for GH folder to Libraries folder  <br>
            <code>    (ex C:\Users\NJ9\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries)</code>
       </p>         
        <h3>WHEN</h3>
        <p>
            September, 19 (Monday), 2016, Part A and B 7:45pm - 10:15pm</br>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
